# ROBLOX-php

Welcome! Once I finish with my Personal PHP ROBLOX Bots, I'll upload them here for others to use. I'm mostly doing this as ROBLOX-js has been discontinued and there aren't really any alternatives at the moment (although ROBLOX-js works fine for now, it probably won't a year from now). 

Although I don't personally know NodeJS, most of the bots will be converted from ROBLOX-js.
