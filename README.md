# ROBLOX-php

Welcome! Once I finish with my Personal PHP ROBLOX Bots, I'll upload them here for others to use. I'm mostly doing this as ROBLOX-js has been discontinued and there aren't really any alternatives at the moment (although ROBLOX-js works fine for now, it probably won't a year from now). 

I don't personally know NodeJS, but most of the bots will be converted from ROBLOX-js.

## Requirments
* cURL
* PHP (Tested with 7.0)

### Notes

I will mostly be trying to do undocumented APIs first. Since the APIs documented at places such as groups.roblox.com are easy to follow and even provide cURL commands, I likely won't get started on those soon. I also won't bother making any sort of files that require some sort of captcha bypass (unless it's via deviceHandles or something).

## Todo
 - Add proper error handling (Most functions are just `if 200 return true`, when 200 might not always mean success)
